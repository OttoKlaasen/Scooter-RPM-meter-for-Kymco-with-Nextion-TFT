# Scooter-RPM-meter-for-Kymco-with-Nextion-TFT
Scooter-RPM-meter-for-Kymco-with-Nextion-TFT, display has yellow Ferrari RPM display, RTC on board, Temp and humid meter and oil meter

This project contains the Arduino code, all STL files for printing, the images file for your Nextion Display and a circuit for the pickup detector.
For the pickup detector i have PCB's available which who have to built yourself, you can have one for 2 euro excluding shipping.

The Arduino i used is a Arduina Nano, further I used a temp.hum sensor and a rtc clock and of course a Nextion Display.
